C++ has quite a few keywords/reserved words that you cannot use as identifiers. These words have specific meanings in the language and can’t be used for anything else. The naming conventions in C++ are a lot like the conventions in Java, if you are already familiar. The variable should start with a lowercase letter and it should typically be a noun. While some of the specific rules are not enforced by the compiler, these conventions make your variables much easier to read. 
C++ is statically typed, meaning that values are attached to types at compile time. It is also a strongly typed language which means that data is predefined within the language. You can make a set of generic data types and accurately represent them. C++ is explicit, too, meaning you need to declare variable types, function parameters, and return values.In general, all objects in C++ are mutable. You can use either const or constexpr when defining an object which is immutable. Given a const object, we can only invoke methods of that object that are also marked as const. 
For C++, the following operators are allowed:
  Arithmetic Operators
    Unary operators (++, –) 
    Binary operators (+,-,*,/)
    Relational Operators 
  Comparison Operators
    Returns boolean value (<,>,=...)
  Logical Operators 
    Combines two or more conditions 
    Returns boolean value (&&, ||, !)
  Bitwise Operators 
    Performs bit-level operations (&, |, ^, <<, >>, ~)
  Assignment Operators 
    Used to assign value to a variable (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)
  Ternary or Conditional Operators 
    Returns value based on condition (?) 
C++ can also perform mathematical operations on different variable types. The compiler will accomplish this by converting both variable types into the easiest one. 
In naming conventions, the use of special characters isn’t allowed except for an underscore (_) or a dash (-).
